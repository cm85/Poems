# The Invisible Mailman

The strangest thing happened today

An invisible mailman passed my way

He handed me something that wasn't quite there

And to receive invisible mail is really quite rare

So I opened this nothing real real wide

To find even less of nothing inside

The penmanship was neat and clean

So clean in face it couldn't be seen

The scent was sweet as I recall

So sweet in fact there was nothing at all

So im writing you back with love you can bet

And thanks for the letter I never did get

Truly right now is a time i need you

But the letter i expected It never came through

Next time girl you should stop and think twice

And pay close attention to this here advice

If things can only change somehow, I can be out there where things are better

And you could be in here expecting a motherfucking letter
