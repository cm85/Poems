<u><h2>The Invisible Mailman</h2></u>
	
	<p><b>The strangest thing happened today<br>
	An invisible mailman passed my way<br>
	He handed me something that wasn't quite there<br>
	And to receive invisible mail is really quite rare<br>
	So I opened this nothing real real wide<br>
	To find even less of nothing inside<br>
	The penmanship was neat and clean<br>
	So clean in face it couldn't be seen<br>
	The scent was sweet as I recall<br>
	So sweet in fact there was nothing at all<br>
	So I'm writing you back with love you can bet<br>
	And thanks for the letter I never did get<br>
	Truly right now is a time i need you<br>
	But the letter i expected It never came through<br>
	Next time girl you should stop and think twice<br>
	And pay close attention to this here advice<br>
	If things can only change somehow, I can be out there where things are better<br>
	And you could be in here expecting a Mother Fucking letter</b></p>
